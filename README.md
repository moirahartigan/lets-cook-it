# Lets Cook It!
## **Code Institute - Portfolio Project 4: _Full-Stack Toolkit_** 
Lets Cook It! is a virtual recipe collection where all your favourite recipes can be saved in the one place.

It is a community based experience that allows casual, one-time users to browse recipes, and allows returning users to create profiles and upload and manage recipes.

### Strategy
#### Site Owners Goals 

 
<br>
The goal for the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information, while striving for a minimalist and user-friendly design.

### Scope

### Structure


#### <em>Website Sections:</em>
* #### Home - 
  * 
  * 
  *  
 <br>
<p align="center">
<img src="">
</p>


 * #### Navigation bar - 
   * The navigation bar is displayed on top right hand side of the screen. 
<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src=""> 
 </p> 
 
 <br>
 
  * For mobile and tablet view there is a hamburger icon which upon clicked slides the nav bar menu out from the right of the screen.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="">
      </p>
 
  
* #### Footer -
   On the footer of the website the user can find our social media icons which are linked to each specific page.
   <br>
   
   <p align="center">
   <img src="">
     </p>
   
  
 * #### 404 Error -
   * A 404 error page has been added to redirect users back to the home page.
<br>

<p align="center">

    </p>
<br>

#### <em>Website Flow</em>
The flow of the site is simple and makes the logical linear progression from : Our Philosophy --> Services --> Contact us.
The user might choose their own route through the page, but the site has been designed to try and maintain their focused interest throughout the journey towards the end goal of completing the contact form and make an enquiry. A call to action button has been added to both the home page, and the services page to allow the user to go directly to the contact section if they wish.

### Skeleton

#### <em>Wireframes</em>




[Wireframe for Mobile](https://github.com/moirahartigan/Ms1-Schools-Out-Childcare/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-mobile-view.pdf)    
[Wireframe for Tablet](https://github.com/moirahartigan/Ms1-Schools-Out-Childcare/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-tablet-view.pdf)  
[Wireframe for Desktop](https://github.com/moirahartigan/Ms1-Schools-Out-Childcare/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-desktop-view.pdf)  


### Surface
#### <em>Colour Scheme</em>
I chose a simple colour palette to allow the focus to be on the images and the information provided. The background colour alternates between a plain white background and an image. I applied an dark gradient overlay to each background image used throughout the site. This was done to avoid distraction and to draw the users eye to the information sitting on the images. I used the below colours to highlight the navigation links and call to action buttons on the landing page, the services page and the contact page.

* Palette:
                                                                                                      
<p align="center">                                                                                           
 <img src="">
</p>
                                                                                                                   
#### <em>Typography</em>
The font-families chosen are Poppins and Lora. For consistency I used Poppins for headings and titles and Lora was used for the sub heading of services and Find us.
#### <em>Imagery</em>
Imagery plays a very important part in the design for this website. I chose bright colourful images that complimented each other on the page while highlighting a fun and enjoyable care service.

# Testing
### Validator Testing
At the completion or heavy editing of sections, I used the following to check my code for syntax errors:


#### <em>HTML Validator</em>

  <p align="center">  
 <img src=""> 
 </p>
  
  
* The warning returned from the html validator identified the navigation section was lacking a heading - however a business logo was used in place of a heading for this section. 
#### <em>CSS Validator</em>

  <p align="center">  
  <img src="
  ">
 </p>
    
    
* All pages came back with no errors.
 
### Lighthouse Testing
I used Chromes Lighthouse tools to test the site's performance. I made sure to check both desktop and mobile performances. Below are the screenshots from both tests:
